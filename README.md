## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.9 with the following packages:
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - A powerful data analysis toolkit.

Jupyter Lab 3.3.2 is required

- *Jupyter Lab is primarily used as a web-based development environment for the notebooks, code, and data associated with this project.  Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science*
